# Terraform-NR_install
Example tf scripts for installing NR agents

The infra install example will spin up 3 ubuntu t2.micro servers, create a loadbalancer, install Apache web server and New Relic Infra agent and then rename the Apache index.html to show that all 3 servers are working, and then give values for the domains and IPs.
